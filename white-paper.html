                <p>
                  NFT Knox was founded on the concept of utility, bridging
                  blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to link
                  real-world assets with digital representations. At its core,
                  NFT Knox securely stores high-value, real-world assets and
                  permanently ties each asset to a transferable and redeemable
                  NFT. Our service uniquely leverages blockchain to unlock
                  highly-liquid transactions on traditionally slow-churn,
                  high-friction product categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the primary focus of NFTs to date has been on novelty
                  digital art, our technology scales NFT technology to
                  accommodate any number of physical items - for example, graded
                  collectibles, commissioned paintings, or even high-end
                  valuables. Traditional transactions on real-world assets
                  involve real risk. Damage, theft, authentication, and
                  insurance can be costly and incur transaction time due to
                  shipping. With NFT Knox, conducting transactions on
                  authenticated, secure real-world assets is as simple and rapid
                  as sending an email.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At NFT Knox’s core is the concept of utility: correlation of a
                  physical asset with a digital representation contains immense
                  value. An NFT is a clear answer to how to represent that
                  physical asset. An NFT’s unique digital address, combined with
                  blockchain’s consensus-based ledger, provide a technology that
                  ensures the stable digital representation of a client’s
                  physical asset.
                </p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>
                      NFT technology brings the power of innovation and creation
                      to digitally speak for any real-world element. The
                      publicity of the metaverse should not be solely related to
                      the benefits of a digital world … the connection between
                      it and real life is where the real excitement lies. NFT
                      Knox is spearheading technology allowing clients to access
                      valuables in both spaces.

                    <p>
                      NFT Knox enables consensus verification of NFT ownership
                      through the minting process, which allows the mirroring of
                      a physical collectible or asset in digital format. This
                      consensus is accomplished by (at minimum) memorializing a
                      high-resolution video or image of the possession in
                      question on the chain, and the immutable record is what
                      verifies ownership rather than any singular entity
                      granting that authority

                <p>
                  The physical assets that NFT Knox hold have a combination of
                  emotional, financial, or sentimental importance, and the
                  security and insurance procedures we have in place match that
                  significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  NFT Knox understands the storage of an asset must ensure
                  preservation. Equally as important, the trust in our storage
                  process must be unwavering and transparent. We store assets in
                  temperature-, humidity-, and UV-protected conditions with both
                  active and passive fire protection measures in place. We have
                  also enhanced the security associated with these measures as
                  an additional layer of protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our facilities have 24-hour monitoring and redundant security
                  systems in place to ensure the physical security of our
                  assets. While we don’t disclose the precise location of our
                  secured assets, NFT Knox does participate in routine,
                  transparent 3rd-party audits of our entire inventory to
                  maintain the confidence of our clients.

                  PHYSICAL REPRESENTATIONS - NFT KNOX PROOFs
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By design, secure storage of physical assets in the NFT Knox
                  vault limits our clients’ access to their assets. As such, we
                  provide a mechanism for clients to retain some tactile,
                  physical representation of their asset in the NFT Knox vault –
                  we created NFT Knox PROOFS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Building on NFT Knox PROOFS, we have also developed a
                  warranted document verifying ownership of the asset in
                  question for copyrighted items. We offer these NFT Knox
                  CERTIFIED PROOFS to each collector or individual as part of
                  our purchasing process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  NFT Knox PROOFS offer a stunning visual presentation for our
                  client assets that lack copyright complications. We offer NFT
                  Knox PROOFS through our platform at the owner's preference,
                  from the most basic representation to a near indistinguishable
                  replica.

                    <p>
                      At any time, the sole owner of an Asset-Backed NFT can
                      redeem the physical asset. NFT Knox's process for
                      validating the owner’s physical mailed address, as
                      documented in this whitepaper, gives all parties
                      transparency as to where the asset will ultimately reside
                      should an asset redemption be triggered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A redemption operation is simple. The owner initiates the
                      process by transferring their NFT to the NFT Knox
                      redemption wallet and NFT Knox cryptographically verifies
                      the integrity of the owner-submitted mailing address. For
                      added security, an email requesting the completion of that
                      same signature process ensures an up-to-date mailing
                      address for the pending redemption
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Upon completion of any successful redemption process, the
                      NFT associated with the redeemed asset is burned
                      (destroyed) through our automated process. The creation of
                      a newly minted NFT would occur should the owner who
                      redeemed the asset wish to re-introduce it into the NFT
                      Knox platform, ship it to one of our facilities, and
                      restart the cycle.

                <p>
                  For every NFT sold through our minting process, NFT Knox takes
                  a specific percentage of commission:
                </p>
                <h3>Value of Asset</h3>
                <!-- here will come a table -->
                <p>
                  This is in addition to a 2.5% commission charged by OpenSea on
                  every sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On subsequent sales, while the asset remains in NFT Knox’s
                  possession without redemption, a 1% commission is charged on
                  each transaction and awarded to the original minting owner as
                  well as NFT Knox. This is once again in addition to a 2.5%

                  The NFT Knox platform is a one-of-a-kind solution for
                  versatility, scalability, and connecting NFTs to tangible
                  assets. In addition, its modular structure enables the smooth
                  integration of blockchain technology and the implementation of
                  third-party NFT marketplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our current web-based platform consists of two core components
                  1) a backend framework using Python, commercial cloud
                  services, and API integration; 2) a frontend written in HTML,
                  CSS, and Javascript. Integral to our frontend is our signature
                  process, which interfaces with MetaMask to digitally sign and
                  register ownership to the NFT and asset. This digital
                  signature is a critical component to our verification and
                  redemption process.
                </p>

                  NFT Knox is not trying to operate simply in the digital space.
                  We aim to connect a variety of physical asset classes with
                  digital representations – to both improve authenticity and
                  streamline the buying & selling of high-friction physical
                  assets. We believe NFT Knox Asset-Backed NFT represent a sea
                  change for NFTs and are among the first real-world use-case
                  for NFT technology.

                <p>
                  NFT Knox starts the Asset-Backed NFT concept with a
                  collectible set of comic books. Later editions issued will
                  include other collectibles such as trading cards and action
                  figures. Further development includes the NFT Knox Portfolio
                  feature, where a collector has the ability to track their
                  collection’s value in real time. Collectors will also use this
                  feature to sort their collection by type of collectible.
